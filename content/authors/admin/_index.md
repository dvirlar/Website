Hello there, and welcome to my brand new, very-much-so-under-construction website! I’m Daphne, and currently I am unemployed &mdash; woo! I quit my most recent job as an [environmental planner](https://www.rinconconsultants.com/) to take a step back from the corporate world, reconnect with my passions and realign with my values, and spend some time on a couple of passion projects. Currently, those projects include volunteering, building out this website, [learning python](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/lecture/5440650#overview), and applying to every job under the sun that sparks my interests. In the words of [Kim Kardashian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3P7ST3U9Ss), "it's a full time job." When I'm resting, I enjoy listening to a [variety](https://myfavoritemurder.com/) [of](https://www.ted.com/podcasts/worklife) [podcasts](https://www.alieward.com/ologies) while walking my dog.

Although this website is under construction, feel free to poke around, grab a glass of tea, and get cozy. Whether you’ve come from a random google search or a job application I’ve sent in, thank you for taking the time to stop by! I hope the pandemic has been kind to you. Failing that, I hope you’ve at least been kind to yourself. Take care, and have a wonderful day.
