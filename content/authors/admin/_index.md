Hello there! Welcome to my brand new, very-much-so-under-construction website. Currently, I'm job searching for data science positions that include programming, statistical analysis, and/or geospatial analysis, as well as positions in the environmental field. Recently,  I quit my job as an [environmental planner](https://www.rinconconsultants.com/) to take a step back from the work force, reconnect with my passions, realign with my values, and spend time pursuing passion projects. Currently, that includes volunteering, building this website, [learning python](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/lecture/5440650#overview), and applying to every job under the sun that sparks my interests. [Collectively, it's a full time job.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3P7ST3U9Ss) When I'm resting, I enjoy listening to a variety of podcasts while walking my dog.<sub> [1](https://myfavoritemurder.com/)</sub><sub>,</sub>

Although this website is under construction, feel free to poke around, grab a glass of tea, and get cozy. Whether you’ve come from a random google search or a job application I’ve sent in, thank you for taking the time to stop by! I hope the pandemic has been kind to you. Failing that, I hope you’ve at least been kind to yourself. Take care, and have a wonderful day.
